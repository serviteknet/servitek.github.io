      <description>The growth of corporate environmentalism has made its mark in industry as companies of every size and scope recognize the benefits of eco-conscious operations. For many business owners, going green is simply the right thing to do to minimize the organization&amp;rsquo;s overall carbon footprint. However, green practices can also have a direct impact on a company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. A 2013 study revealed that a whopping 71 percent of all Americans consider the environment before making a purchase, granting ecologically aware companies an opportunity to edge out the competition just by doing what&amp;rsquo;s best for the our collective ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Benefits And Challenges Of Passive Solar Heating</title>
      <link>/blog/2019/03/benefits-and-challenges-of-passive-solar-heating/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2019/03/benefits-and-challenges-of-passive-solar-heating/</guid>
      <description>Passive solar power is changing the green heating game for companies across multiple industries. Unlike active solar designs that require expensive systems and external energy sources to power pumps, blowers, and equipment, a passive design utilizes already existing energy and leverages features of the building itself to generate heat throughout the structure. Put simply: passive solar heating strategically uses material choices, design elements, and feature placements of basic components found in most living spaces (think windows, floors, and walls) to create a smart, green environment.</description>

      <description>Most business owners and property management firms recognize the many aesthetic and sanitation benefits gained by using professional commercial cleaning services. However, many building owners don’t realize that customized janitorial solutions do more than help protect the office from surface germs as well as impress visitors with sparkling workspaces. When used consistently, thorough and effective commercial cleaning routines may actually mitigate the risk of workplace injuries.
Outsource Your Janitorial Cleaning Needs To A Professional, Experienced Provider Some executives initially assume that it’s more cost effective to have employees and tenants manage their own janitorial needs internally.</description>

      <description>Property managers recognize that tenant retention is everything. According to a white paper released in 2013 entitled, The Economic Cost of Losing a Tenant, failing to retain a commercial facility tenant isn’t just inconvenient, but also expensive. Data gathered in the report indicated that losing and replacing a renter can cost up to three times more than simply renewing a lease, making it essential to keep renters engaged and (more importantly) satisfied throughout the contract.</description>

      <description>As a business owner, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen firsthand how energy (or, more specifically, wasted energy) costs quickly add up. Excessive electricity consumption in commercial buildings is a national epidemic. Recent statistics from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that a typical facility wastes, on average, 30% of its overall energy use.
Reduce Your Carbon Footprint (And Utility Bills) Many entrepreneurs assume that energy inefficiency is just the cost of doing business, particularly for operations in buildings outfitted before &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; innovations and technologies.</description>
