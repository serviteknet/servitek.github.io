      <description>At Servi-Tek, we believe in a commitment to excellence in everything we do. As leaders in the facilities management and commercial cleaning vertical, we strive to offer more than just the status quo. We continuously challenge ourselves to raise the performance bar and redefine what success looks like.
Most importantly, at Servi-Tek we don&amp;rsquo;t just demand a lot from ourselves professionally. We also promote an internal culture where we are constantly pushing and supporting each other as we seek to better ourselves personally as well.</description>
